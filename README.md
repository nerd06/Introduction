### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning on Design and Development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like flutter, javascript, react, HTML5, CSS, and SASS as well as programming with Python.

I also enjoy learning wireframing, UI, UX and design in general (still beginner though). 

I'm currently working on my own website and currently on design stage.
